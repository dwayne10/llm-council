Task List for Upgrading Council + Retrieval

Design Retrieval Strategy Mix

Define priority sources beyond news: arXiv (per /lukasschwab/arxiv.py docs), Semantic Scholar, vendor blogs, internal repos, etc.
Decide freshness horizons per source (daily for news/blogs, weekly for arXiv) and map each to retrieval method (API, RSS, scraping).
Build Retrieval Adapters

Implement async adapters for each source (e.g., arXiv API wrapper for “state of the art AI/ML” queries, company blog RSS fetcher, GitHub release notes).
Normalize outputs to {source, published_at, title, summary, url, content} so council prompts can cite uniformly.
Add Vector Index + Long-Term Memory

Stand up an embedding pipeline and vector store (FAISS, pgvector, etc.) that ingests fetched articles/papers for re-use.
Provide retriever that blends keyword API hits with semantic similarity over cached corpus.
Implement Retrieval Orchestrator

Create a routing layer that selects adapters based on query intent (e.g., “LLM benchmarks” hits arXiv + vendor blogs, “product release” hits news).
Support weighted merging/deduplication plus knob for number of passages per source.
Enhance Stage 1 Prompting

Expand prompt to differentiate between “research-grade papers” vs “news summaries,” instructing models to cite with [Source #n] + reference type.
Include guardrails for conflicting info: ask models to note disagreements across sources.
Council Composition Review

Evaluate models that excel at long-context technical reasoning (e.g., DeepSeek, Claude Research). Adjust COUNCIL_MODELS accordingly.
Consider specialist roles (code-focused model, math-heavy model) and weight their votes differently in Stage 2.
Metadata & Frontend Surfacing

Persist full context objects per message and expose filters in Stage 1 tabs (e.g., toggle “Only papers”).
Add UI affordances to expand abstracts, download PDFs, or link to original repositories.
** Quality + Safety Checks**

Add automated evals: compare synthesized answer vs. retrieved sources for hallucination detection.
Log retrieval coverage (which adapters fired) per request for debugging.
Operational Considerations

Implement caching + rate-limit handling for scholarly APIs.
Add background jobs to refresh vector index nightly so Stage 1 doesn’t hit APIs every time for popular topics.
